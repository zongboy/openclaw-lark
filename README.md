This is the official Lark/Feishu plugin for OpenClaw, developed and maintained by the Lark/Feishu Open Platform team. It seamlessly connects your OpenClaw Agent to your Lark/Feishu workspace, enabling it to directly read from and write to messages, docs, bases, calendars, tasks, and more.

## Features

This plugin provides comprehensive Lark/Feishu integration for OpenClaw, including:

| Category | Capabilities |
|------|------|
| 💬 Messenger | Read messages (group/DM history, thread replies), send messages, reply to messages, search messages, download images/files |
| 📄 Docs | Create, update, and read documents |
| 📊 Base | Create/manage bases, tables, fields, records (CRUD, batch operations, advanced filtering), views |
| 📈 Sheets | Create, edit, and view spreadsheets |
| 📅 Calendar | Manage calendars and events (create/query/update/delete/search), manage attendees, check free/busy status |
| ✅ Tasks | Manage tasks (create/query/update/complete), manage task lists, subtasks, and comments |

Additionally, the plugin supports:
- **📱 Interactive Cards**: Real-time status updates (Thinking/Generating/Complete), plus confirmation buttons for sensitive operations
- **🌊 Streaming Responses**: Live streaming text directly within message cards
- **🔒 Permission Policies**: Flexible access control policies for DMs and group chats
- **⚙️ Advanced Group Configuration**: Per-group settings including allowlists, skill bindings, and custom system prompts
- **🧩 Dynamic Agent Creation**: Optional per-DM-user or per-group agent/workspace isolation with automatic agent and binding creation

## Security & Risk Warnings (Read Before Use)

**Core risk:** This plugin connects to your work data via Lark/Feishu APIs—messages, docs, calendars, contacts. Anything the AI can read could theoretically be leaked. While we have implemented security protections, AI systems are not yet mature or stable enough to guarantee absolute safety.

**Strong recommendations:**
- Use a personal account for evaluation and testing at this stage.
- Use the related Lark/Feishu apps personally, and avoid deploying to large numbers of users.
- Avoid using it in group chats to reduce the risk of data exposure.
- Using this bot for multiple users and/or with a company Feishu account may introduce data security and privacy risks. Make sure you comply with your organization’s internal data security and privacy requirements to avoid data leakage, privilege escalation, privacy violations, or related consequences.

**Other operational risks**
- AI is not perfect and may hallucinate: It may sometimes misunderstand your intent or generate content that appears reasonable but is inaccurate.
- Some operations are irreversible: For example, messages sent by the AI on your behalf are sent in your name and cannot be undone once sent.
- **Mitigation advice:** For important operations involving sending, modifying, or writing data, always **preview first, then confirm**. Never allow the AI to operate in a fully autonomous mode without human oversight.
